# Hands-on Tutorials on JWST Data Analysis for the [International Virtual Course on Astronomy Institut Teknologi Bandung 2022](https://www.as.itb.ac.id/ivcas2022/)  

This repository contains materials for a tutorial on the JWST NIRCam imaging data analysis. The tutorial will be given as part of the [IVC Astronomy ITB 2022](https://www.as.itb.ac.id/ivcas2022/) on August 16, 2022. In this tutorial, we will learn basic anlysis on JWST data, both simulated and the real one.

## What we will learn
In this tutorial, we will learn the following skills
* Point Spread Function matching of imaging data across multiple bands
* Creating color RGB images
* Detection and source extraction of astronomical objects in an image
* Aperture photometry and extracting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies
* Photometric redshift measurement
* SED fitting for measuring the stellar population properties of galaxies
* **Optional**: Dissecting spatially resolved properties of galaxies
