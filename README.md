# Hands-on Tutorials on JWST Data Analysis for the [International Virtual Course on Astronomy ITB 2022](https://www.as.itb.ac.id/ivcas2022/)  

This repository contains materials for a tutorial on an analysis of the JWST NIRCam imaging data. The tutorial will be given as part of the [IVC Astronomy ITB 2022](https://www.as.itb.ac.id/ivcas2022/) on August 16, 2022. In this tutorial, we will learn basic anlysis of JWST data, both simulated data and the real one.

## What we will learn
In this tutorial, we will learn the following skills
* Point Spread Function (PSF) matching of imaging data across multiple bands
* Creating color RGB images
* Detection and source extraction of astronomical objects in an image
* Aperture photometry and extracting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies in the field
* Photometric redshift measurement
* Performing SED fitting for measuring stellar population properties of galaxies
* **Optional**: Dissecting spatially resolved properties of galaxies with [piXedfit](https://pixedfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Data Resources
* Simulated JWST/NIRCam imaging data from the [Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS)](https://ceers.github.io/) survey. The data that we will analyze, simulated data release v3, are available in the CEERS's webiste [here](https://ceers.github.io/sdr3.html#nircam-imaging-one)
* First data from the JWST Early Release Observations (ERO) on [SMACS 0723 cluster](https://www.nasa.gov/webbfirstimages). For this tutorial, we will be using the JWST/NIRCam and HST processed data product on SMACS 0723 cluster that are produced by [Gabriel Brammer](https://gbrammer.github.io/) using [grizli](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli) and publicly available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/grizli-v2/SMACS0723/Test/image_index.html

You can download the data from the above links or alternatively, you can follow the instructions below and download the required data from the google drive links that are listed there.   

## Preparations
### Software Dependencies and Installation
The codes in this tutorial are all written in Python and can be conveniently run on the jupyter notebook platform. Preferably run on a Linux operating system. Before running the codes, you need to install the following softwares or dependencies
* Python 3.5 or later
* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* Basic Python packages for astronomy: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [pysao](https://pypi.org/project/pysao/). These packages are easy to be installed using pip or conda. 
* Photometric analysis packages: [Photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [SEP](https://sep.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.x/index.html) Source Extractor ([Bertin & Arnouts 1996](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A%26AS..117..393B/abstract)). These packages are also easy to be installed. Please follow the installation procedure in their webistes.
* Photometric redshift tool [EAZY](https://github.com/gbrammer/eazy-photoz) ([Brammer, van Dokkum & Coppi (2008)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...686.1503B/abstract)). Please follow the installation instruction in the EAZY's GitHub page or its older website [here](http://www.astro.yale.edu/eazy/). A documentation in PDF file also available [here](http://www.astro.yale.edu/eazy/eazy_manual.pdf).
* SED fitting tool [piXedfit](https://pixedfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is a bit more difficult to install, please follow the installation procedure at https://pixedfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html.

### Download the Required Data
Please follow the instructions below
* Clone this GitHub repository to your local computer
```
cd <desired_dir>
git clone https://github.com/aabdurrouf/ivcitb2022.git
```
* Download PSF matching **kernels** from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3aBZ1tj8DOlLbfZMD85Gd1SuW8KE871/view?usp=sharing and put the files into `ivcitb2022/kernels/` directory
* Download CEERS simulated NIRCam Images from https://drive.google.com/file/d/159tKQlbkaWKH4MRJwrBX2MnBLc_SSiXW/view?usp=sharing and put the files into `ivcitb2022/CEERS/` directory and then decompress it.
* Download JWST and HST images of SMACS 0723. Follow the instruction at https://github.com/aabdurrouf/ivcitb2022/tree/main/ERO_SMACS0723. You can run the download script (`download.sh`) inside `ivcitb2022/ERO_SMACS0723/data` directory.
